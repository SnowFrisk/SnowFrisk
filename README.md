Dear Mr. / Ms. spectator,

  I am Tianran Li, an actor of this worldly stage - Github, and I appreciate the opportunity to perform here.
  
  I write code to design my movements on the stage. Unfortunately, actor is only my part-time job, I have to spend the majority of my time on the full-time job - a student in high school.
  
  As I am only an amateur actor, I am most likely not as experienced as you, my spectator; so it would be my pleasure if you would like to take a look at my code and my movements, to comment and to criticize them.
  
  Thank you for your attention and patience for this opening. Last but definitely not the least, please allow me to express my respect and honor to all who works on open-souce programming. Your presence is essential and indispensable for the software industry.
  
  Scene.
  
Sincerely,
Tianran Li
